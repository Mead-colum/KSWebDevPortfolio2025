				<header>Excerpt from: What is video game piracy?, from 'Red Point', by Ben Bailey</header>
				<p>
					Video game piracy damages the reputation of the developers and distributors of the game. If your game is widely pirated this is usually an indication that your digital rights management (DRM) software and policies are failing. This reflects poorly on the professionalism and seriousness of your business. Consumers will lose trust in your business and look elsewhere for their video game needs. The value of your video game copyright will suffer.</p>
				<p>
					Video game piracy places an enormous burden on the customer support team. They will act as the first line of defense and contact for confused and angry customers. If your video game is widely pirated then your customer support team will be overloaded with complaints and reports of piracy. In an ideal world, this is not what you want your customer support team to be dealing with following the launch of your game.

				<p>While it makes sense for a company whose function it is to take down infringements on intellictual property to have such a ridgid view on pircay. The few points I've singled out feel more like fluff points. DRMs are widely considered by consumers a bane on video gaming as a whole, so to state consumers would lose trust in your business would be incorrect in my eyes.</p>
				<P> 
					Secondly, I don't believe people swamp customer service when a game is pirated. People will probably pirate every game released, what would even incentivise people report such a thing, how would they even know? If anything people would swamp customer service with calls about cheating more.
