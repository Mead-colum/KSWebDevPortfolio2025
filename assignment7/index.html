				<header>What is A.D.L?</header>
				<p>ADL’s beliefs are that A dog’s love isn’t false, they may still have ulterior motives baked into them ‘aka the thing about them being so personable’.but as long as you show love to your dog, the being they become will be pure. They say part of the being’s punishment is the short lifespan compared to humans, but when a dog passes it starts the journey of puppyhood anew, and when a dog has found true happiness throughout all its lifes it ascends.</p>
				<p> The Group, A.D.L (A Dog’s Love) Centers around a dog who ascends and has their owner create this website on their behalf to spread the word. ADL loves dogs and hopes to welcome our new ascended companions into a world where they can help us learn to be at peace with one another. As there aren’t many studies around a topic that doesn’t exist I plan to twist dog myths/ quirks and studies to fit the narrative of dogs being ready to evolve or have always acted in a way that seems like they know more than they do.</p>
